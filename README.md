# Country_Club_App
A full functioning app (server + database + client) for a physical business (country club, library, bus companies, restaurant orders etc).

This app has been made for a country club, but can easly be changed for every need.
The client is written with React code and the server is written with Java (Spring Framework)
The Database can be H2 or MySQL(go to the server code --> src/main/resources --> application, and choose which one to work with).

Couldn't have done it without: Daniel Aizenband, Lior Perlman, Nadav Rud, Lior Toledano, Imry Ashur.
